How to use `fpho` with your images

## Data
This is the data that is required to be input

### Frames

Requirements for images are:

* They must all be the same dimension (for now), preferably 2048 by 2048.  Ideally they will be square but this is not a strict requirement.
* They must have dimensions that are an integer multiple of 8.
* The headers must contain a valid WCS (i.e. `"CRPIX"`, `"CRVAL"`, and `"CD"` or `"PC"` + `"CDELT"` matrix keywords.)
   (e.g. `astropy.wcs.WCS(astropy.io.fits.getheader(imname))` must not raise an error.)
* The headers of all frames must contain a `"FILTER"` keyword with string value, and preferably an `"ABMAG"` zeropoint keyword.
* There _must_ be a -pixel-matched uncertainty image associated with every science image, in same units as the science image.  Ideally the uncertainty image will have a filename that is easily generated from the science image filename (i.e. by a simple substitution)

Optionally each image may also have an associated background image and pixel mask image.

* The background image should be the same units as the science image, and will be subtracted from it during preprocessing.
* The mask image can be an array of bitflags or a simple array of 0 (False, do not use this pixel) and 1 (True, use this pixel)


Units

* Fluxes will be reported in image units (which should be 'per-pixel', not surface brightness)  Therefore, when fitting several images in a single FILTER it is highly desirable that all images be on the same flux scale.  If the `"ABMAG"` header keyword is present, pixel stores will automatically try to convert images to units of nJy/pixel.
* the WCS should map pixel indices to RA,DEC pairs, in decimal degrees


### Ancillary info

* The PSF must be known and provided.  It should be representable as a mixture of gaussians (there is code to compute this mixture from an image)
* There must be a catalog of initial (celestial or on-sky) positions.  This will be preprocessed/rectified to have a number of qualities.
* Ideally this catalog would contain rough estimates of the flux scale for the objects.
* You must obtain the splined Gaussian mixture amplitudes for Sersic profile approximations.  A default set of splines is provided, but is appropriate for a particular range of half-light radii.


## Preprocessing

To run `fpho`, several preprocessing steps are required.  Generally these will be accompished by a `preprocessing.py` script.  Since much of this is a script for converting your data into the types oif information required by `fpho`, it is user specific.

1. *Generate pixel data stores*
   
   This step produces HDF files of pixel data organized into superpixels, with backgrounds subtracted and masks applied.  Each `"FILTER"` will be contained in a separate HDF5 group, each frame will be a subgroup of that, with datasets corresponding to pixel data

2. *Generate metadata store*
   
   This step produces a json file containing all the header information, organized similarly to the pixel data but as a dictionary of dictionaries (keyed by `"FILTER"` and then by image name)

3. *Generate PSF store*
   
   This step creates an HDF5 file containing PSF information.  This information consists of a set of Gaussians describing the PSFs, as HDF datasets keyed


## Catalog

A catalog module will be used to convert your catalog to the format required by `fpho`.  This involves filling in any missing parameter initializations with initial guesses, converting positions to celestial positions, and other minor junk.


## The `config` file

This is where paths and options are specified.
