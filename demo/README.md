# Demos

It would be nice to show

 1. `demo1/` - The covariances between adjacent sources as a function of the
    ratio of distance to rhalf and the flux ratios.
 2. `demo2/` - The difference in posteriors between fitting multiple (different
    resolution) bands separately versus simultaneously.
 3. `demo3/` - The impact of pixel covariances by fitting at the exposure level
    and then at the mosaic level.
 4. `demo4/` - Demonstrating the use of superscenes to sample smaller scenes in
    a Gibbs-like fashion.
 3. Biases due to color gradients, or unmodeled substructure.
