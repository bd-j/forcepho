# Demos

It would be nice to show

 - [x] `demo1/` - Pairs: The covariances between adjacent sources as a function of the
    ratio of distance to rhalf and the flux ratios.
 - [ ] `demo2/` - Colors: The difference in posteriors between fitting multiple (different
    resolution) bands separately versus simultaneously.
 - [ ] `demo3/` - Mosaics: The impact of pixel covariances by fitting at the exposure level
    and then at the mosaic level.
 - [ ] `demo4/` - Demonstrating the use of superscenes to sample smaller scenes in
    a Gibbs-like fashion.
 - [ ] Biases due to color gradients, or unmodeled substructure.
