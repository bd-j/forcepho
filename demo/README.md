# Demos

It would be nice to show

 1. The covariances between adjacent sources as a function of the ratio distance/rhalf
 2. The difference in posteriors between fitting multiple (different resolution) bands separately versus simultaneously.
 4. The impact of pixel covariances by fitting at the exposure level and then at the mosaic level.
 3. Biases due to color gradients, or unmodeled substructure.
