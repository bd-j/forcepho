# Demos

It would be nice to show

- [ ] `demo_basic/` - Basic: Trace, residuals, and corner plot for a single
   source in a single band.  Show posterior PDFs as a function of S/N

- [x] `demo_pair/` - Pairs: The covariances between adjacent sources as a function of the
    ratio of distance to rhalf and the flux ratios.

- [x] `demo_color/` - Colors: The difference in posteriors between fitting multiple (different
    resolution) bands separately versus simultaneously.

- [ ] `demo_mosaic/` - Mosaics: The impact of pixel covariances by fitting at the exposure level
    and then at the mosaic level.

- [ ] `demo_scene/` - Demonstrating the use of superscenes to sample smaller scenes in
    a Gibbs-like fashion.

- [ ] Biases due to color gradients, or unmodeled substructure.
