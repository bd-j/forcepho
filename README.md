Forward modeled photometry using a source model based on

1) mixtures of gaussian approximations to galaxies and the PSF

or

2) Draws from the source flux and position distribution (phonions) and a polynomial approximation to the PRF

The goal is to simultaneously forward model all relevant imaging data for a collection of nearby sources.  This should lead both to higher accuracy and better understanding of uncertainties than traditional techniques.
